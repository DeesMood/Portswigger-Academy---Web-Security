# Why Stages?

The BSCP exam is split into 3 stages for 2 application. The purpose of mapping the vulnerability is to work on the exam in a more focused manner, as the exam itself is only 4 hours only.

# What is BINGOS?

It's a compilation of possible vulnerabilities for the BSCP exam. I made it based on this table originally from [here](https://github.com/botesjuan/Burp-Suite-Certified-Practitioner-Exam-Study/raw/main/images/3stages.png) but modified by adding more possible vulns.
