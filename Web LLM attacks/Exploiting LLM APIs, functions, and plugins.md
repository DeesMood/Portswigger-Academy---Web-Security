 website can give third-party LLMs access to its specific functionality by describing local APIs for the LLM to use.

# How LLM APIs work

The workflow for this could look something like the following:
1. The client calls the LLM with the user's prompt.
2. The LLM detects that a function needs to be called and returns a JSON object containing arguments adhering to the external API's schema.
3. The client calls the function with the provided arguments.
4. The client processes the function's response.
5. The client calls the LLM again, appending the function response as a new message.
6. The LLM calls the external API with the function response.
7. The LLM summarizes the results of this API call back to the user.
